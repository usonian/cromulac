Long ago I wrote a PHP script which generated pseudorandom words based on the ubiquitous /usr/share/dict file.  The only markov scripts I'm finding online deal with sentences, not words - or if they deal with words, they rely only on consonant/syllable patterns for password generation.

So, time to reimplement in Python.
